# easydr

Easydr is an mvc framework for Dart, available at the moment:

**Template manager for server side dart applications.
This is the first library which will be part of a server side dark MVC framework.
The Template class is supposed to be used together with a dependency injector container
so that the same template object can be reused with different parameters.
After Cloning the repo you should run 'pub get' in order to let the demo work.


**Simple Server as App class, it will load templates and configurations and put them in the "to be done" Deependency
injector container

**NOTE - This repo is at its really early stage, this readme will improve as well as the documentation(which now is non existent)**
